# Mobile-Application-545-
Project for CSS 545
1. I intend for the final project to be runnable on an Android device, but potentially also be runnable on an iOS device.
2. I intend to use TypeScript and React Native on VSCode to develop my application but may continue to do research on if there is a better framwork me to use. This is the structure that I have developed with before but I am actively looking for a different perhaps more robust or convenient way to achieve my goal.
3. I want to explore cross-platform development as I will be developing from a Windows computer for a iOS device but if I come across limitations I may decide to stick to virtual Android emulators to run my project until I find a better solution.
