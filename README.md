# Mobile-Application-545-
By Davis Zhong
HW Projects for CSS 545
1. I intend for the final project to be runnable on an Android device, but potentially also be runnable on an iOS device. Ideally my application would be functional on my personal iPhone but I've had trouble doing this in the past with my currently planned project structure so I will at least make it functional on virtual Android emulators and see if I can move it to my iPhone at a later time.
2. I intend to use TypeScript and React Native on VSCode to develop my application but may continue to do research on if there is a better framwork me to use. This is the structure that I have developed with before but I am actively looking for a different perhaps more robust or convenient way to achieve my goal.
3. I want to explore cross-platform development as I will be developing from a Windows computer for a iOS device but if I come across limitations I may decide to stick to virtual Android emulators to run my project until I find a better solution.

## Storage Options for React Native Expo Alarm App

### Storage Types and Solutions

| **Storage Type**           | **Option**                      | **Pros**                                                                                                      | **Cons**                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User Information**        | AsyncStorage                    | Simple to implement, good for small, non-sensitive data like user preferences.                                  | Limited capacity (~6MB), no encryption, not secure for sensitive data.                                         |
|                            | SecureStore (expo-secure-store)  | Secure, encrypted storage for sensitive data like credentials.                                                 | Not suitable for large or complex data, slower due to encryption.                                              |
|                            | Firebase Firestore               | Scalable, real-time syncing across devices, good for user profiles.                                             | Requires user authentication management, can incur costs as usage scales.                                      |
|                            | SQLite (expo-sqlite)             | Ideal for structured, offline data storage with complex queries.                                                | Requires database management, adds complexity for schema and syncing.                                          |
| **Alarm History**           | AsyncStorage                    | Suitable for small alarm history, easy and quick to retrieve.                                                   | Limited capacity, not ideal for large or complex data storage.                                                 |
|                            | SQLite                           | Good for structured, historical data with complex queries, works offline.                                       | Requires schema management, setup more complex than key-value storage.                                         |
|                            | Firebase Firestore               | Real-time syncing, scalable for long-term alarm history records.                                                | Potential costs with large data storage, needs cloud connectivity.                                             |
| **Device Tokens / IDs**     | SecureStore                     | Secure storage for notification tokens, ensuring privacy.                                                       | Inefficient for handling many tokens, not for large-scale token management.                                    |
|                            | Firebase Firestore / Realtime DB | Scalable and secure, great for managing notification tokens, integrates with Firebase Cloud Messaging.           | Requires network connectivity, can increase costs with large-scale usage.                                      |
|                            | AsyncStorage                    | Simple for storing local device tokens.                                                                         | Not secure for sensitive tokens, suitable only for non-critical identifiers.                                   |
| **Audio Files**             | Expo FileSystem (expo-file-system)| Great for storing local media files, flexible and cross-platform.                                               | Manual file path management, no built-in encryption, requires cache management.                                |
|                            | Firebase Cloud Storage           | Scalable for uploading/storing alarm sounds, accessible across devices.                                         | Requires user permissions, can incur costs with large file storage, needs network connectivity.                 |
|                            | AWS S3                           | Highly scalable, cost-efficient, ideal for large-scale media storage.                                            | Complex setup for permissions and file encryption, more work to configure than Firebase.                       |
| **Custom Audio Uploads**    | Expo FileSystem                 | Suitable for local storage of custom user-uploaded audio.                                                       | No cloud backup or multi-device sync without additional setup, data loss risk on device switch.                 |
|                            | Firebase Cloud Storage           | Seamless across devices, scalable, ideal for large audio files.                                                 | Costs associated with large file uploads, requires network connectivity.                                       |
|                            | AWS S3                           | Secure and scalable for custom uploads, handles large-scale data well.                                          | More complex to set up access and permissions securely, more setup than Firebase.                              |
| **Temporary Cache**         | AsyncStorage                    | Easy solution for caching small temporary data, quick to implement.                                             | Limited size, not suited for caching large media or complex data.                                               |
|                            | Expo FileSystem                 | Excellent for larger media caching, provides manual cache management.                                           | Manual cache cleanup required, no automatic cache expiration.                                                  |
|                            | react-native-cache-manager       | Efficient for managing cached media with auto-expiration.                                                       | Requires integration with file system for handling large files.                                                |
