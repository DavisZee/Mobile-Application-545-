# Mobile-Application-545-
By Davis Zhong
Project for CSS 545
1. I intend for the final project to be runnable on an Android device, but potentially also be runnable on an iOS device. Ideally my application would be functional on my personal iPhone but I've had trouble doing this in the past with my currently planned project structure so I will at least make it functional on virtual Android emulators and see if I can move it to my iPhone at a later time.
2. I intend to use TypeScript and React Native on VSCode to develop my application but may continue to do research on if there is a better framwork me to use. This is the structure that I have developed with before but I am actively looking for a different perhaps more robust or convenient way to achieve my goal.
3. I want to explore cross-platform development as I will be developing from a Windows computer for a iOS device but if I come across limitations I may decide to stick to virtual Android emulators to run my project until I find a better solution.
